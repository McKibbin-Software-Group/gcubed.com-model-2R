# USA tariff trade war with the rest of the world.

Tariff increases are imposed by the USA on the rest of the world. These increases are reciprocated.

The experiment has two forms, one based on calculating the tariff revenue in the usual way, within the model using a linear approximation to the tariff-revenue function.

The alternative form of the experiment does the tariff revenue calculation outside of the model to allow for non-linearities.
