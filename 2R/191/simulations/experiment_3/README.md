# Unexpected reversal of a permanent increase to inflation target in the USA.

The USA inflation target (INFX) is temporarily increased by 1 percentage point (to 3.5%).

To achieve the unexpected nature of the policy reversal, two simulation layers are required. The first simulation layer has an earlier event year and implies that the policy change is permanent. The second simulation layer has a later event year, when the reversal occurs and becomes public information. That second layer reverse the original shocks from its event year onwards.
